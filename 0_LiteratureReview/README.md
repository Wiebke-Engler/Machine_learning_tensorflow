Approaches or solutions that have been tried before on similar projects.

**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [Curriculum learning-based strategy for low-density archaeological mound detection from historical maps in India and Pakistan]

  - **[Link]()** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38190-x
  - **Objective**:Find mounds on historical maps to find potential archaeological sites
  - **Methods**: Computer vision, synthetic data, curriculum learning
  - **Outcomes**: 6000 mounds were identified (2 algorhithms: a recall value of 52.61% and a precision of 82.31% for the first, and a recall value of 70.80% and a precision of 70.29% for the second)
  - **Relation to the Project**: Same goal

- **Source 2**: [Machine Learning Arrives in Archaeology]

  - **[Link]()** https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351713328_Machine_Learning_Arrives_in_Archaeology
  - **Objective**: ML in archaeology
  - **Methods**: ML
  - **Outcomes**: Promising results but archaeological data is not as consitent and can be prone to biases 
  - **Relation to the Project**: what are some drawbacks to keep in mind

- **Source 3**: [Potential of using Machine learning
Technology to predict site location of
Burial Sites in the Åland Islands.]

  - **Objective**: evaluating a high–resolution LiDAR dataset
  - **Methods**: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), U-net model
  - **Outcomes**: Some results but a lot of false positves
  - **Relation to the Project**: Similar goal
